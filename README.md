# Do You Even Lift

A simple website built with Gatsby and Styled components for my gym routine. The routine si split into three days with two main muscle groups worked on each day.

- Day 1: Chest & Triceps

- Day 2: Back & Biceps

- Day 3: Legs & Shoulders

## How to Follow

Each day has multiple exercises (explained below) and in general you should be aiming for 3 sets of each exercise. The goal of this program is to develop strength, so you should be choosing fairly heave weights and aim for 10 reps on set 1, 8 reps on set 2 and 6 reps on set 3. You should generally do a very light warm up set of each exercise just to engage the muscle groups used.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a personal trainer, this is just a repo for my workout routine and I figured building a small website will help me follow it and be productive in the gym. There are likely many better routines and guides available, but I have used this routine to start getting into resistance training and done well with it so far.

## Warm Up

You should always warm up, I tend to do a few basic stretches, 5-10 mins cardio (bike, treadmill etc) and usually some skipping. It is not really important what you do, just be sure to do something to warm your body and muscles up.

## Day 1

Day one is built up of 8 different exercises, three sets of each as described above. Except for the _Bench Dips_, I tend to just do three sets of 10 for those with them just being a bodyweight exercise. Here is the total list for day 1:

- Bench Press
- Incline Dumbbell bench press
- Dumbbell fly
- Cable Crossover
- Bench Dips
- Tricep Rope pulldown
- 1 arm overhead extension
- Skull Crusher

## Day 2

Day two has 8 exercises, all three sets other than the last set - **Barbell Curl** - where I do a set of 21s, if you are unsure how to perform 21s then [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih_U-ChDJWE) youtube video will help:

- Deadlift
- Bench Row
- Reverse Fly
- Lat Pull Down
- Barbell Row
- Hammer Curls
- EZ-Bar Curls
- Barbell Curl 21s

## Day 3

Day 3 has 9 exercises, all three sets as described above:

- Leg Extension
- Leg Curl
- Goblet Squat
- Seated Calf Raise
- Low Bar Squat
- Dumb Bell Shoulder Press
- Bent-Over Dumbbell Lateral Raise
- Dumbbell Lateral Raise
- Shrugs

## What's Next

In it's current state this is an extremely simple website, but it serves it's purpose - offering me a quick and easy way to get my routine on my phone, so that I know exactly what I am doing. Having said that, once doing a routine for a couple of weeks you commit it to memory, so it would be more useful to have a way of recording my workouts, in terms of number of reps at what weight etc.

So, when time allows the pla is to hook this site up to firebase and offer the ability to start a new workout, which will go through each set asking for your weights and reps. Then the next logical step would be a section for outputting your results and showing progress over time.

If time is no object the next feature would be some type of logic to help the user decide when to move up or down in weight based off of their inputs, however it is unlikely I get to this stage. Mainly because I do not know enough about resistance training to offer this type of advice. Also time is unfortunately not no object, so in reality I probably wouldn't get around to this even if it is something I could do.

### Final Thoughts

This is more of a personal project meant only to be used by me. However I do like to learn and experiment in the open so I figured I would make this repo public. But again, I am no expert with fitness or resistance training, so this is unliekly to be super useful for others - other than an idea you could implement for your own routine.
